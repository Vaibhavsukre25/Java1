 * Constructor - What is needed for the mere survival of the object is added during construction phase
 * A constructor is defined like a method, but the method will have the same class name with no return or void
 * Constructor can be empty or it can also have parameter.
 * The name of the class and the constructor should be same
 * The constructors are called exactly before the object is ready.
 * By default all classes have default constructor that is empty constructor
 * if you want u can override that, by writing your own constructor
